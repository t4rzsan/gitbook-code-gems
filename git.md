# Git

## Cloning

Start by cloning a repo from Github or Bitbucket.org.

```
git clone https://github.com/t4rzsan/icsharp.git
```

This will create a subfolder of the current folder name "aspnet-core-with-webpack" containing all the code.

If the repo contains submodules, and you want to bring the code in the submodules donw, you'll need to clone recursively.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/t4rzsan/icsharp.git
```
